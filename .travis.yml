deploy:
  # travis ci has built in providers such as aws, digital ocean etc.
  provider: elasticbeanstalk
  # the region of your beanstalk instance, look at the instance url
  region: "us-east-2"
  # app name as specifies in your beanstalk instance
  app: "docker-react"
  # environment name
  env: "Dockerreact-env"
  # travis will zip all your files and send them over to an s3 bucket
  # which is ultimately a hard drive. Then travis alerts elastic beanstalk to 
  # deploy the application. This s3 bucket is automatically generated
